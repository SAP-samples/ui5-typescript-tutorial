# ui5-typescript-tutorial - Learn App Development in UI5 and TypeScript
## Description

[In its `main` branch, this repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/blob/main/README.md) contains the instructions for the ui5-typescript-tutorial. For all further information, [go there](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/blob/main/README.md).

## Runnable Apps

The result of each exercise is a gradually extended app, starting from the empty template. Here you can have a look at each stage of the app after doing the respective exercise.<br>
The main link opens the partially optimized build result where TypeScript sourcemaps are not available, but there is also a "debug" version where the original TypeScript sources can be debugged.

- [Exercise 1 - Create And Run Your Application](2022/exercises/ex1/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex1/debug/))
- [Exercise 2 - Create the Initial User Interface and Load Data](2022/exercises/ex2/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex2/debug/))
- [Exercise 3 - Add Translated UI Texts](2022/exercises/ex3/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex3/debug/))
- [Exercise 4 - Enhance the User Interface and Use Formatters](2022/exercises/ex4/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex4/debug/))
- [Exercise 5 - Create a Second View](2022/exercises/ex5/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex5/debug/))
- [Exercise 6 - Load Incidence History Data](2022/exercises/ex6/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex6/debug/))
- [Exercise 7 - Create and Use a Custom Control](2022/exercises/ex7/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex7/debug/))
- [Exercise 8 - Using NPM Packages](2022/exercises/ex8/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex8/debug/))
- [Exercise 9 - Beautifying the Chart](2022/exercises/ex9/) ([debug version](2022/exercises/ex9/debug/))

In case the data cannot be loaded from the public API, you can see [the final stage of the application here](2022/exercises/backup/) (using a backup copy of the data). [Here](2022/exercises/backup/debug/) is the debuggable version.
