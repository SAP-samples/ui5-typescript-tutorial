# ui5-typescript-tutorial - Learn App Development in UI5 and TypeScript

## Description

These are the running app samples of the updated 2023 ui5-typescript-tutorial. 

[In its `main` branch, this repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/blob/main/README.md) contains the respective tutorial instructions.



## Runnable Apps

The result of each exercise is a gradually extended app, starting from the empty template. Here you can have a look at each stage of the app after doing the respective exercise.<br>
<!--The main link opens the partially optimized build result where TypeScript sourcemaps are not available, but there is also a "debug" version where the original TypeScript sources can be debugged.-->

- [Exercise 1 - Create And Run Your Application](exercises/ex1/) (and the [test coverage report](exercises/ex1/coverage/report-html/index.html)) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex1/debug/)) -->
- [Exercise 2 - Create the Initial User Interface and Load Data](exercises/ex2/) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex2/debug/)) -->
- [Exercise 3 - React on User Input](exercises/ex3/) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex3/debug/)) -->
- [Exercise 4 - Use Third-Party NPM Packages](exercises/ex4/) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex4/debug/)) -->
- [Exercise 5 - Create and Use a Custom Control](exercises/ex5/) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex5/debug/)) -->
- [Exercise 6 - Testing](exercises/ex6/) (and [unit tests](exercises/ex6/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html) + [OPA integration tests](exercises/ex6/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html)) <!-- ([debug version](exercises/ex6/debug/)) -->

<!--In case the data cannot be loaded from the public API, you can see [the final stage of the application here](exercises/backup/) (using a backup copy of the data). [Here](exercises/backup/debug/) is the debuggable version.-->
